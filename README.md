# CWOM Action List
This is the code for the CWOM demo shown at IMPACT.  This is a custom web app built specifically to highlight CWOM and AppDynamics working together.  As such, this is meant for demo purposes and the art of the possible. The demo is custom code and not an officially supported product of CWOM or Appdynamics. 

Currently this pulls in the actions from a CWOM instance for AppServer and VM’s only.  When executing an action, it also removes the action but does not execute it since this code is meant for demo purposes.  There is work being done to get this to a full fledged field integration that a customer could use. The idea is a customer could host this custom web app and this would be loaded into the AppDynamics UI via an Iframe. The code is distributed as is.  

## Required Frameworks

1. NodeJS

References:

* https://nodejs.org/en/download/


## Installing

1. Download the latest release https://github.com/Appdynamics/CWOM-Action-Integration
1. Change into the directory: `cd CWOM-Action-Integration`
1. Download npm dependencies: `npm install`
1. Create a config.json file in the root directory with the following :

```
{
	"localport":3000,
    "https":true,
	"cwom_config": {
		"turboserver": "https://my.turbo.server.com",
		"username": "<username>",
		"password": "<password>",
		"businessApplicationId": "<uuid>"
	}

}
```

If you copy the above default text, you can still run the node.js server. cwom_config is only required if you are connecting to a cwom instance. There is a demo page that can display fake actions if you do not have a cwom instance available. See Documentation section below.

* `localport`: the port that the node.js server will be started on
* `https`: use the https protocol
* `turboserver`: url to the cwom instance
* `username`: username of user that can pull actions via the API
* `password`: password of user that can pull actions via the api
* `businessApplicationId`: CWOM Business Application ID we are pulling actions for. can be found by navigating to Business Application and looking at url "u/app/#/view/main/businessApplicationId"


6. Start node.js: `npm start`
7. Open browser to:
   http://localhost:3000

Example page with real action data: http://localhost:3000/views/examples/cwom.html 

Example page with fake action data for demo purposes (if you don't have a cwom instance to hook into): http://localhost:3000/views/examples/cwomMockData.html.html

# AppDynamics Dashboard
If you want to display the custom web app along side a custom dashboard, an iframe component can be used pointed to the webapp.  Make sure that Security Sandbox IFrame is unchecked when adding iframe component. The config file for the dashboard used at impact can be found in the root directory as `business-impact-dashboard.json`.  Just import the file into your dashboard page and update the health rules and iframe to point to the correct location.
